Is this true: embodied conversational agents rely on nonverbal means?,"Embodied conversational agents do rely on nonverbal means, although the degree to which they rely on these methods varies. There are several types of nonverbal communication that these agents can utilize in order to communicate with humans, such as visual communication, haptics (tactile), voice, and other types of communication. It is important to remember that the way in which a human communicates with other humans is highly subjective to the type of communication they are engaging in and the environment where they are engaging in communication (Brown, 2004). The nonverbal communication used by humans in an intimate setting is likely to be different from the type of nonverbal communication utilized by a human in a large public space.,Brown, P. (2004).

This has been a key area of research in the MT field in recent years and this integration has led to significant advancements in MT technology. Pivot MT is a technique that involves pre-translating a document into multiple languages, each translation using a different translation model, and then using the best translation from each model to generate a final, multilingual version of the document. Interactive MT, on the other hand, involves using human feedback to improve the translation quality. Finally, multilingual text authoring involves using a translation memory (TM) to store previously translated segments of text, which can then be used to improve the translation quality of new text. The integration of these three approaches has led to significant advancements in MT quality, making it an increasingly popular technology in a variety of industries."

This means that a large number of training samples are required to effectively train the network and learn a meaningful embedding.,In the context of training CNN embeddings, training samples refer to the images or other data that the CNN is trained on. The training process involves feeding the CNN a large set of training images, each with its own unique features and properties, and then training the CNN to identify and extract the most important features from each image. The CNN is then able to extract a lower-dimensional embedding of the training images, which can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, such as image recognition or classification.,In order for the CNN to effectively extract a low dimensional embedding, it needs to be trained on a large number of training samples. The more training samples that"

Is this true: experimental results show effectiveness of strategies?,"The experimental results suggest that the strategies are effective. They show that a particular strategy is effective at a particular level of noise, but they are silent on whether the same strategy is effective at other levels of noise. This is one of the reasons that the results are not definitive: we have no idea whether a strategy that is effective at a particular level of noise might be less effective at other levels of noise.,The experimental results do not suggest effectiveness. They show that a strategy is effective on the average. But this does not mean that it's always effective. It's conceivable that the strategy is effective for some inputs, and then ineffective for other inputs. For example, the strategy may be effective for inputs that are not very noisy, and ineffective for inputs that are very noisy.,The experimental results don't suggest effectiveness either. They only show how the strategy behaves for some inputs. In particular, they do not show that the strategy is effective for all inputs. So"

Is this true: offset adaptation model improved phase locking?,"The offset adaptation model improves phase locking for the following two reasons: The first reason relates to the fact that the offset correction model is an integral model of the closed-loop system. An integral model has a zero transfer function between its input and output, and so, by the principle of causality, the output of the model can only be affected by what happened before it started. Thus, the only effect the offset correction model can have on a signal is to delay its arrival. This delay can only improve the phase locking if the signal arrives with a delay that is already larger than it is for the other signals. The second reason is related to the fact that the offset correction model can only reduce the amount of phase locking in the closed-loop system if the delay of the other signals is less than that of the signal for which it has to compensate. The only way for this to be true is if the signal has a larger amplitude than the other signals, and the only way for this to be true is if the"
