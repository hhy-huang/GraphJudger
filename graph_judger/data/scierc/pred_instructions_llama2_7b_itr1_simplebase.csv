Is this true: Embedding preserves Distance?,"Embedding preserves distance if the distance between nodes in the embedding is the same as the distance between nodes in the embedding. This does not mean that nodes will be the same distance apart. In some cases, embedding a graph can cause nodes to be further apart and in other cases it can cause nodes to be closer together. For example, if a graph contains two nodes that are close to each other, such"
