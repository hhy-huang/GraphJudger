L'Oisans is a region in the French Alps, located in the départements of l'Isère and Hautes-Alpes, and corresponding to the drainage basin of the River Romanche and its tributaries (Eau d'Olle, Lignarre, Sarenne, Vénéon and Ferrand). Between Livet-et-Gavet and Le Bourg-d'Oisans, the Romanche forms a deep gorge.Its geographical definition coincides almost exactly with the former cantons of Le Bourg-d'Oisans (Isère) and La Grave (Hautes Alpes).The Oisans covers parts of the massifs of Belledonne, Taillefer, Grandes Rousses, Arves and Écrins.The highest point in the region is the mountain of "Pic Lory", a subpeak of the Barre des Écrins which reaches a height of 4,088 metres, but the most symbolic peak is la Meije which is nicknamed the "Queen of the Oisans".The Oisans is a remarkable territory, thanks to its numerous mountain chains, valleys, rivers, streams and plains.The Oisans is a very touristic region, both for winter and summer sports. Oisans regularly hosts the Tour de France as well as many major sporting events on a European scale (Super-Biker, World of Snowboarding, Skiing World, the Bike Festival, Andros Trophy or the Criterium Cyclist of Dauphiné Libéré).The provincial road 1091 (formerly RN 91) is the main access road into this area, beginning in the town of Livet-et-Gavet. In recent years, the RD1091 has been significantly upgraded, with various ring roads that provide faster access and more enjoyable access to the Oisans.The town of Bourg d'Oisans is the equivalent of the capital of this territory because this town is at the centre of six valleys.The main towns are Bourg d'Oisans, Les Deux Alpes, Livet-et-Gavet and Huez.

The 2011 National League Division Series (abbreviated NLDS) were two best-of-five playoffs comprising the opening round of the Major League Baseball postseason, played to determine the participating teams in the 2011 National League Championship Series. Three divisional winners and a fourth team—a wild card—played in two series. TBS televised all games in the United States (except Game 3 of the Brewers–Diamondbacks series, which aired on TNT due to scheduling conflicts with the ALDS). The regular season finished on September 28, with the National League playoffs beginning October 1.Under MLB's playoff format, no two teams from the same division were matched up in the Division Series, regardless of whether their records would normally indicate such a matchup. Home field advantage went to the team with the better regular-season record with the exception of the wild card team, which defers home field advantage regardless of record. The matchups are:* (1) Philadelphia Phillies (East Division champions, 102–60) vs. (4) St. Louis Cardinals (Wild Card qualifier, 90–72): Cardinals won the series, 3–2.* (2) Milwaukee Brewers (Central Division champions, 96–66) vs. (3) Arizona Diamondbacks (West Division champions, 94–68): Brewers won the series, 3–2.The Phillies and Cardinals played against each other in the postseason for the first time. The Brewers and Diamondbacks also met for the first time, having both joined the National League in 1998—Arizona as an expansion team and Milwaukee in a move from the American League after the AL expanded by adding the Tampa Bay Rays. The Brewers-Diamondbacks series was also notable as the first postseason series played between two teams in ballparks with retractable roofs.This is the first time since the strike-shortened 1981 season that both National League Division Series matchups went to a deciding Game 5 (it happened to the American League in 2001).

Graptolite Island is an island long in the north-east part of Fitchie Bay, lying off the south-east portion of Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands of Antarctica. James Weddell's chart published in 1825 shows two islands in essentially this position. Existence of a single island was determined in 1903 by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition under William Speirs Bruce, who so named it because what were thought to be graptolite fossils were found there. Later analysis showed that the fossils on Graptolite Island were merely the remains of ancient plants.

The 2011 New York Red Bulls season was the club's seventeenth year of existence, as well as its sixteenth season in Major League Soccer, the top-flight of American soccer.After a successful turnaround season in 2010, in which Red Bulls finished in third place overall before losing in the quarterfinals of the post-season tournament, the club started 2011 hoping to find consistency, make a deeper run in the MLS Cup Playoffs, and vie for the Supporters Shield. By season's end it was clear the club failed on all three fronts. Red Bulls were labeled the biggest underachievers in MLS after performing with a maddening inconsistency, struggling even to earn the 10th and final spot in an expanded playoff field, and falling again in the playoff quarterfinals.Prior to the 2011 MLS season, New York Red Bulls manager Hans Backe declared that the club's goal for the season was to win the Shield, claiming that it was more of a test for the league title rather than the MLS Cup, which he called a "crapshoot". As this goal drifted out of reach, Backe backtracked from his Supporters' Shield emphasis and remarkably blamed international call-ups due to the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup as the reason the Shield was unobtainable. New York ended the season 21 points shy of the Shield. At the conclusion of the season, Backe acknowledged that he didn't know the biennial CONCACAF tournament was being held in 2011. That lack of awareness seemed to haunt the club throughout the season, both on field and off. The average MLS regular season and playoff home attendance of the New York Red Bulls in 2011 was 20,000.

Western Cattle in Storm is a $1 stamp issued by the United States Post Office Department as part of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Issue. "Western Cattle in Storm" is one of nine commemorative postage stamps in the series, which marked the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha, Nebraska. While the entire Trans-Mississippi Issue set has been praised for its quality, viewed by generations of U. S. stamp specialists as "one of the most beautiful sets of postage stamps our country has ever issued," the $1 stamp, also called the "Black Bull", stands out from the rest.The breed of cattle used in the issue were meant to represent the ruggedness of the American West, but actually derive from the Highlands of Scotland. That's because the design originated in a John MacWhirter painting (1878) depicting cattle in a winter storm in central Scotland. An engraving of this painting by one C. O. Murray was published at least twice in England, and this image, copied, without the permission of the painting's owner, Lord Blythswood, was used by an American cattle company on its calendar as a trademark of sorts."MacWhirter, however, was a Scot, and his painting, entitled "The Vanguard", was soon discovered to have been a depiction of Scottish cattle in a storm in Scotland," according to a company called Chicago Stamps. "It was actually painted in a small farmhouse near the Scottish highland town of Calendar. The scene did not depict an event west of the Mississippi, but it might have been, and few really cared about this detail, for cattle were an important part of the western U.S. economy." (Note: the correct spelling of the town is Callander.)This image caught the attention of the Post Office Department and Raymond Ostrander Smith, the staff designer of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing at the time, and it was adopted for the $1 design. Little did the designer know that the scene depicted was in Scotland, not the Western U.S., as was supposed. A full apology was later issued to the owner of the painting. Both the frame and the vignette of the stamp were engraved by Marcus W. Baldwin; the numerals and lettering were the work of Douglas S. Ronaldson.
The Moore Mountains () are a small but conspicuous group of mountains just north of New Year Pass in the Queen Elizabeth Range in Antarctica.

Chernobyl Way (, ) is an annual rally held on April 26 by the opposition in Belarus as a remembrance of the Chernobyl disaster.The first time it was held in 1989 with demands of urgent efforts in eliminating the consequences of the catastrophe. That year, about 30,000 participants marched from LUCH, Minsk Watch Plant, through the downtown to the Square of Independence and held a rally there.In 1996, the largest Chernobyl Way was held in Minsk marking the 10th anniversary since the Chernobyl disaster. It was the first Chernobyl Way during Lukashenko's presidency. About 50,000 people gathered together at the Academy of Sciences and marched on the main street of Minsk (Independence Avenue). There were many clashes with the police, the demonstrators were dispersed by OMON and many political activists protesting against Lukashenko’s regime were detained. Among those detained were journalists and opposition leaders, namely Yury Khadyka, Lyavon Barshchewski, Vyachaslau Siuchyk, Vincuk Viačorka. After this rally opposition leader Zianon Pazniak left the country. Staff of the Maksim Bahdanovič Literary Museum started helping the arrested and their families and this is how the Viasna Human Rights Center was created.

Louis Dufresne (18 January 1752, Champien, near Peronne – 11 October 1832) was a French ornithologist and taxidermist.Louis Dufresne was one of the naturalists on board the "Astrolabe", which accompanied by the "Boussole", left Brest in August 1785 on a voyage of discovery. The ships went first to Madeira and Tenerife, then to Trinidad and then to the coast of Brazil (including Santa Catarina Island). Rounding Cape Horn the expedition landed at Concepción and on to the Sandwich Islands and then sailed north along the coast of north-west America to Alaska. In 1786, the expedition resumed this time visiting Monterey before crossing the Pacific to land in Macao in China. In 1787 the boats returned to France.Six years later in 1793, Dufresne became a taxidermist and curator at Museum d'Histoire Naturelle. His work included the classification and arrangement of collections of invertebrates as well as vertebrates and he visited many parts of the world on behalf of the Museum. In 1802 he popularized the use of arsenical soap for preserving birds in an article in "Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle" a technique which had enabled the Muséum to build the greatest collection of birds in the world.Dufresne also maintained a private collection which by 1818 consisted of 1,600 bird specimens (on wooden supports and with both with Latin and French names), 800 world eggs, 4,000 shells, fossils, amphibians, corals and 12,000 insects. This collection purchased for the University of Edinburgh in 1819. In 1854 the University transferred the Natural History Museum into the government ownership to form a publicly-funded national museum, which became the Royal Scottish Museum (now part of National Museums Scotland).In 1829 Dufresne was awarded the Legion of Honour. He died of lung disease.

Diphenolic acid is a carboxylic acid with molecular formula C17H18O4. Its IUPAC name is 4,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid, and it can be prepared by the condensation reaction of phenol with levulinic acid in the presence of hydrochloric acid. The equation for this synthesis is::2 C6H5OH + CH3C(O)CH2CH2COOH → CH3C("p"-C6H4OH)2CH2CH2COOH + H2ODiphenolic acid is a solid at room temperature, melting at 168–171 °C and boiling at 507 °C. According to its MSDS, diphenolic acid is soluble in ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, acetic acid, and methyl ethyl ketone, but insoluble in benzene, carbon tetrachloride, and xylene.Diphenolic acid may be a suitable replacement for bisphenol A as a plasticizer.Diphenolate esters have been used to synthesize epoxy resins as a replacement for the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A.The diglycidyl ethers of n-alkyl diphenolate esters have similar thermomechanical properties to the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A when cured, but the viscosity and glass transition temperature vary as a function of the ester length. Diphenolate esters have also been used to synthesize polycarbonates with a potential for water solubility.

The Mystic Schooners are a collegiate summer baseball team that operates in the Mystic, Connecticut region. The franchise is one of the two oldest franchises in the New England Collegiate Baseball League.Originally known as the Eastern Tides, and later the Thread City Tides, playing in Willimantic, Connecticut, the franchise was purchased by former Boston Red Sox General Manager Dan Duquette in 2004. Duquette's club was first known as the Berkshire Dukes, playing their home games at the Dan Duquette Sports Academy in Hinsdale, Massachusetts. Duquette moved the team to nearby Pittsfield in 2005 after reaching a lease agreement with the city that brought the Dukes to historic Wahconah Park. In November 2008 the team changed its name to the Pittsfield American Defenders after the ownership group that owned the American Defenders of New Hampshire, which included Duquette, bought into the team.The team had struggled to compete in the NECBL since moving to Berkshire County, and did not enjoy a winning season or a playoff berth until 2008. The team's level of play has rebounded greatly since the disastrous summer of 2005, where the Dukes finished at a league-worst 11-31, the fourth fewest wins in NECBL history. The Defenders' fan base has continued to grow despite the team's struggles on the field, with a reported home attendance of 28,955 in 2007, the fourth-highest in the league.In December 2009, the Defenders were sold to the Bristol Collegiate Baseball Club which moved the original franchise back to its beginning state of Connecticut.On January 14, 2009 it was announced that the team's nickname would be the Bristol Nine, and team general manager Dan Kennedy unveiled a logo featuring "...the old looking player and the old style hat and the man with the mustache and the whole nine yards." The logo's design was credited to Bristol resident Brian Rooney. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that the logo in question was actually the trademarked property of Top of the Third, Incorporated, owners of a minor-professional baseball team in Visalia, California. The logo, the creation of graphic designer Dan Simon, had originally been used by the California League's Mudville Nine. The Bristol Nine name was then abandoned, with team management adopting the Bristol Collegiate Baseball Club brand.Following a one-year stint in Bristol, the team moved to Mystic, Connecticut for the 2011 season and was rebranded as the Mystic Schooners.

The South Fork Eel River Wilderness is a wilderness area located in Mendocino County, California. The wilderness was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System when the United States Congress passed the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act in 2006 (Public Law 109-362). The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the agency in charge.The wilderness is broken into two sections. The Red Mountain unit is dominated by Red Mountain and the Cedar Creek (South Fork Eel River) drainage. Elevations range from at the southwest end along Cedar Creek to , less than three miles away at the top Red Mountain. Terrain is generally steep, consisting of rugged drainages dropping abruptly into Cedar Creek canyon. A small area of fairly gentle slopes is found near the summit. A zone of reddish soil occupies the central part of the area and contrasts sharply with the surrounding landscape.These unusual soils have resulted in a unique vegetation cover of several species of pine and cypress trees intermixed with a low brush understory. Rare and endangered plant species occupy the landscape covered by these ultrabasic soils. These rare plants have been isolated over space and time on serpentine rock near the summit of Red Mountain. This edaphic sky island holds the northern range extension of Sargent cypress ("Cupressus sargentii"). This is also the only location to find Red Mountain buckwheat ("Eriogonum kelloggii") and Red Mountain stonecrop ("Sedum eastwoodiae"). Much of the area is designated and Research Natural Area (RNA) / Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC).The red soil on Red Mountain is in the Littlered series. It is an Ultisol, a Haplohumult, with nearly 50% iron oxides. The main iron oxide is goethite (FeOOH), with enough hematite(Fe2O3)to make the soil red.The southern section called Cahto Peak unit consists of several Douglas fir forest watersheds, one of which is so pristine that it has been designated a Biosphere Reserve, a National Natural Landmark, and a Hydrologic Benchmark. Much of the area is designated a RNA / ACEC.

Edgware Way Grassland or Edgware Way Rough is a 6.7 hectare Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation in Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is traversed by Edgwarebury Brook and contains traces of a planned railway viaduct and embankment. This was part of a planned extension of the Northern line from Edgware to Bushey, which was cancelled when the introduction of the Green Belt after the Second World War led to the cancellation of the developments which the railway was to serve. Part of the site is the Environment Agency's Edgwarebury Park Flood Storage Area. The reserve is typical unimproved London Clay grassland. Damp, herb rich areas have uncommon plants characteristic of old meadows such as great burnet, sneezewort and devil's bit scabious. The brook is lined by sedges and water-cress, while breeding birds include yellowhammer and spotted flycatcher.The reserve adjoins Edgwarebury Park. It is private land, but is crossed by a public footpath from Edgware Way which starts just west of the junction with Spur Road.

"On Physical Lines of Force" is a four-part paper written by James Clerk Maxwell published in 1861. In it, Maxwell derived the equations of electromagnetism in conjunction with a "sea" of "molecular vortices" which he used to model Faraday's lines of force. Maxwell had studied and commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when "On Faraday's Lines of Force" was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Maxwell made an analogy between the density of this medium and the magnetic permeability, as well as an analogy between the transverse elasticity and the dielectric constant, and using the results of a prior experiment by Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch performed in 1856, he established a connection between the speed of light and the speed of propagation of waves in this medium.The paper ushered in a new era of classical electrodynamics and catalyzed further progress in the mathematical field of vector calculus. Because of this, it is considered one of the most historically significant publications in physics and science in general, comparable with Einstein's "Annus Mirabilis papers" and Newton's "Principia Mathematica".
The Staten Island Tunnel is an abandoned, incomplete railway/subway tunnel in New York City. It was intended to connect railways on Staten Island (precursors to the modern-day Staten Island Railway) to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, in Brooklyn, via a new crossing under the Narrows. Planned to extend , the tunnel would have been among the world's longest at the time of its planning, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Construction began in 1923, and the tunnel was excavated into the Narrows before New York City Mayor John Hylan, a former Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) employee and initial proponent of the tunnel, canceled the project in 1925. The tunnel lies dormant under Owl's Head Park in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Later proposals to complete the tunnel, including the 1939 plans for the Independent Subway System's ambitious Second System, were never funded.Modern proposals for completion of the tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis Fidler, who in 2007 proposed a 0.33% tax for the tri-state region to pay for the construction. The tunnel was listed as one of many projects that could receive federal funds that were to have been allocated to the Access to the Region's Core tunnel, which was canceled in October 2010. State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.

Dr. S. M. Pandit (Sambanand Monappa Pandit; 25 March 1916 – 30 March 1993) was one of the most popular and much sought-after painters of his times, especially in the school of Realism in contrast to the contemporaneous net-traditionalist Bengal Renaissance and other Indian modern art movements. Most of his subjects oscillated between events from classical Indian literature including the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and the contemporary cinema of his times. He infused a rare blend of artistic virtuosity and filmi glamour to his portrayal of romantic characters like Radha-Krishna, Nala-Damayanti, and Viswamitra-Menaka as also the many heroes and heroines of Hindi cinema. In addition to his critically acclaimed masterpieces he also illustrated many popular film posters, film magazines and various other publications in what can collectively be termed as "calendar art". His works remain hugely popular even today. His mythological paintings and calendar art have been collected widely. He is also widely celebrated in the Indian calendar industry for his "realistic" depiction (albeit inspired by contemporary Indian cinema) of themes from Hindu mythology. In these paintings he emphasised the physical forms of the heroes, heroines, gods and goddesses in marked contrast to traditional and classical styles of Indian painting. In his paintings, Pandit depicted his subjects as handsome, muscular, valorous men and sensuously beautiful, voluptuous women set in surroundings suggestive of cinema settings and sceneries.

The Boston Bridge is a structure that crosses the Youghiogheny River between Versailles and Elizabeth Township, Pennsylvania. Its name is derived from the Massachusetts city only indirectly: the bridge is named for the Boston neighborhood of Elizabeth Township, which in turn was named for the New England city.The bridge, which opened in 1931, carries Pennsylvania Route 48 on two relatively narrow lanes. Many of its features were carefully preserved during a 1989 rehabilitation, down to its original pedestrian railings. Designed entirely for vehicular traffic, the structure changed the future of Elizabeth Township; the lack of streetcar tracks led to the abandonment of a line that served the then-rural community's small industrial settlements, while the newfound ease of access for motorists to the area's manufacturing regions opened up the township to suburbanization.

The Localism Act 2011 (c. 20) is an Act of Parliament that changes the powers of local government in England. The aim of the act is to facilitate the devolution of decision-making powers from central government control to individuals and communities. The measures affected by the Act include an increase in the number of elected mayors, referendums and the "Local authority’s general power of competence" (Part 1, chapter 1) which states "A local authority has power to do anything that individuals generally may do".The official summary of the act is: Although the act was envisaged as having the potential to bring about wide-scale decentralisation, there have been few significant examples of its implementation. Mayor of Hackney Jules Pipe criticised it, saying that it "does not challenge the deep-rooted centralisation in the UK". One notable outcome of the act has been the combined authorities formed by local authorities pooling their powers of transport and economy and gaining certain functions delegated from central government. As a result, there have been calls for legislation to bring about further devolution to the Core Cities Group, leading to the introduction of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016.

Jim Jumani Johansson (legally "Jim Jumani Immanuel Masauko Kamuzu Banda") (2 May 1973 – 26 January 2019) was a Malawian-Swedish man who claimed to be the son of the late Malawian President Hastings Kamuzu Banda (1898-1997). He changed his name to Jim Jumani Immanuel Masauko Kamuzu Banda. Johansson says that it was after Banda died in 1997 that 'some government officials' told him about who his father really was. Officially, Banda died childless and unmarried. His claim and resemblance to the former dictator opened up many unanswered questions about the legacy of Banda. Johansson became a celebrity overnight in Malawi owing to his uncanny resemblance to the former president and his measures to seek legal means of proving his identity. Malawians were divided on whether he was the true heir but the public demanded a right to know as well. Focus Gwede, the head of Banda's Special Branch of Secret Police Services, came out in support of Johansson, claiming in 2010 that Banda had fathered three children.

The Mikhailovsky Palace () is a grand ducal palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is located on Arts Square and is an example of Empire style neoclassicism. The palace currently houses the main building of the Russian Museum and displays its collections of early, folk, eighteenth, and nineteenth century art. It was originally planned as the residence of Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, the youngest son of Emperor Paul I. Work had not yet begun on the Mikhailovsky Palace, when Paul was overthrown and killed in a palace coup that brought Michael's elder brother to the throne as Alexander I. The new emperor resurrected the idea for a new palace by the time Michael was 22, and plans were drawn up by Carlo Rossi to develop a new site in Saint Petersburg. The palace, built in the neoclassic style, became the centrepiece of an ensemble that took in new streets and squares. It was lavishly decorated, with the interiors costing more than the main construction work. It was gifted to Grand Duke Michael and his new wife, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, by the Emperor in 1825. The grand ducal family had comfortable apartments furnished to their individual tastes. Grand Duke Michael carried out some of his military duties there, while his wife hosted salons that brought together many of the leading members of Saint Petersburg society and culture. The Grand Duchess continued this lifestyle after her husband's death in 1849, until her own death in 1873. The palace was passed on to the couple's daughter, Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna.Over the years of their residency, the family renovated and refurbished the palace's rooms in keeping with contemporary tastes. By the time of Grand Duchess Catherine's death in 1894, the staterooms were no longer in regular use—the family resided for the most part in the palace's wings. With the death of the Grand Duchess, the palace was inherited by her children, who were members of the family of the Dukes of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Concerned about the palace passing out of the Romanov family, Emperor Alexander III decided to buy it back for the state. He died before this could be arranged, but the negotiations were carried out on behalf of his son Emperor Nicholas II, by Minister of Finance Sergei Witte. Nicholas gave it to the newly established Russian Museum, in honour of his father, with the remit that it collect and display domestic art. The palace was extensively renovated to fit its new role, with some of the interiors retained. One wing was demolished and rebuilt, later becoming the Russian Museum of Ethnography, while a new extension, the Benois wing, was added in the 1910s.

John Brandard (Birmingham 1812 – 15 December 1863 London) was an English lithographic artist. He designed many hundred illustrated title-pages for sheet music in what Michael Bryan judged "a pretty, though weak, style". John Brandard was the second of three sons born to Thomas Brandard (d. 1830), engraver and copperplate printer, of Barford Street, Deritend, Birmingham, and his wife, Ann. His older brother was Robert Brandard. John Brandard was baptized on 13 March 1812 at St Martin's church in Birmingham. He began his career as an engraver, mainly of commercial designs. On 17 January 1833 he married Maria Chater at Edgbaston in Birmingham. They had five children, one of whom, Walter Robert Brandard (1842–1869), was also briefly a designer of sheet music covers. He worked in a lifelong partnership with the lithographic printers M. & N. Hanhart, for whom he produced designs for Louis-Antoine Jullien from 1844 until 1856, when Jullien was ruined following a fire which destroyed his entire stock of music."Brandard took the chromolithograph, which had been first used in connection with music in 1841, to an incredibly high level of sophistication, using half a dozen or more stones to produce a single image, printed on paper of a far higher quality than had been used for this purpose hitherto... The colours red and blue predominate in his palette of the 1840s, along with some exquisitely diaphanous draughtsmanship and plentiful use of gold, especially in filigree borders. This latter was something Brandard may have learned when copying medieval illuminations for the Hanharts’ bound music albums. His covers convey an illusion of luxury and refinement, and are clearly aimed at the wealthier sections of society..."Brandard employed two full-time assistants, allowing him to produce artwork quickly and prolifically, mainly concentrating on ballet and opera. His portraits of dancers were admired by Degas. He usually charged 20 guineas for his original artwork and lived well from the proceeds of his art. Described as " an imposing, dandified figure", he would often arrive at theatres in Drury Lane or Covent Garden in his own coach and horses. He was succeeded by Alfred Concanen as master of the illustrated sheet music cover.John Brandard died at his home 8 Southampton Place in Chalk Farm, north London, on 15 December 1863.Collections of his work are held at Reading University, at the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Library at the Bodleian Library in Oxford and the largest collection in America is with Lynch Resources in Edmonds, Wa.

The Kings River Viaduct is a planned series of bridges and embankments carrying California High-Speed Rail over the Kings River in Fresno County and Kings County, California. The site is between the Fresno and Kings–Tulare stations, roughly east of Laton and north of Hanford. The structure is planned to be over long because three river channels must be crossed, two of which were created by floods in the 1860s.In the vicinity of the crossing, the Kings River consists of three widely separated river channels collectively known as the Kings River Complex. From north to south, these are Cole Slough, Dutch John Cut, and the Old Kings River, all of which flow in a westerly direction. Cole Slough and the Old River separate at the People's Weir, the largest weir in the Kings River system. The Old River was the main course of the river until two floods in 1861 and 1867, the first of which created Cole Slough and the second of which caused it to become the river's new main course. Since then the Old River has been dry except when river flows are exceptionally high. Dutch John Cut diverges from Cole Slough east of the bridge site, and joins the Old River to reform the main channel of the Kings River to the west of the bridge site. Cole Slough is then mostly diverted into several canals in the vicinity of Laton.Dirt excavation sites in the vicinity of the bridge will be reused as groundwater recharge basins once construction is complete.

Dark social media, dark social, or dark traffic, are social shares that do not contain any digital referral information about the source. The idea is generally used by web analytics as well as in online advertising. In contrary to the sharing on social networking service like Facebook, which is done publicly, Dark social is done privately through IRC channels, emails, SMS or simply copy-and-paste and other ways of private sharing. Not to confuse with deep web, dark social media is not about the content but the traffic of online sharing. These sharing activities will often come up under the name of direct, typed/bookmarked or other similar form in today's web analytic services. And in 2014, it is believed that Dark Social consisted of 69% of sharing activities globally, whereas Facebook only holds 23%.However, the exact nature of dark social media is still unknown, as the word "dark" in the name itself suggests that unknown or can't-see is in the heart of the concept like dark energy in astronomy.

Their second fund was slated to manage $175 million, although in the wake of co-founder Justin Caldbeck's sexual harassment scandal, the fund's limited partners voted to shut it down.In June 2017, Caldbeck took an indefinite leave of absence following allegations of unwanted sexual advances by several female startup founders. The firm issued the following statement, as reported by The Information.In a statement, Mr. Caldbeck said, "“I strongly deny The Information’s attacks on my character. The fact is, I have always enjoyed respectful relationships with female founders, business partners, and investors.” "Binary issued a statement that said the notion Mr. Caldbeck had "“engaged in improper behavior with female entrepreneurs” was “false.”" Binary said that while the information had "“found a few examples which show that Justin has in the past occasionally dated or flirted with women he met in a professional capacity, let’s be clear: there is no evidence that Justin did anything illegal and there is no evidence that any of his investing decisions were affected by his social interests.”"Reid Hoffman of Greylock Partners and the Founder of LinkedIn, issued the following piece in response: "The Human Rights of Women Entrepreneurs".Days later, Caldbeck issued a statement no longer denying the allegations and publicly apologizing, starting off by saying ""The past 24 hours have been the darkest of my life." Entrepreneur Brendan Mulligan wrote a piece on Medium about Caldbeck's statement: Everything I hate about Justin Caldbeck’s statementFollowing this announcement due to pressure from the media and Limited Partners in the fund, Caldbeck resigned as did new Partner Matt Mazzeo from Lowercase Capital.Jonathan Teo, the last remaining Managing Partner of the fund, issued a statement on Facebook, acknowledging that he knew of Caldbeck's harassment of women from the past and had not acted on it. "I have known Justin in a professional context for many years. I have also heard rumors about him from the past. And he promised me that he had changed. I saw it in his eyes and I believed it. In the second year of our partnership, I had learned of some bad behavior from my partner, but it was evidenced to me that it happened prior to his time at Binary. And I kept my word that his past is the past and I would put it behind me. I love that there is something I can learn from everyone, and I always look for that. The world is quick to judge. Rightly so. There is so much to be outraged about in the current world we live in and this allows us to drive massive change and move on to the next issue to be outraged about. Because there is so much that is damaged in the world.""Although Bloomberg reported that the fund would shut down, it remains in operation with Mr. Teo as Managing Partner.In March 2018, venture capital firm Lerer Hippeau took over the management of Binary’s first fund. The firm completed takeover of Binary’s second fund in April 2018.

The Chantry Island Lighthouse, officially known as Chantry Island Lightstation Tower, is a lightstation on Chantry Island, off the coast of Southampton, Ontario in Lake Huron. It was constructed in the years 1855 through to 1859, by John Brown of Thorold, Ontario, under the authority of the Province of Canada and is recognized as one of the six Imperial Towers. Virtually identical, they were completed in 1858-1859 on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay and are among the few lighthouses on the Great Lakes made of cut limestone and granite (not brick, metal, wood or concrete).This lighthouse was planned in about 1850 because underwater shoals of massive granite boulders made navigation in the area dangerous. There are many accounts from the 1800s on of disasters and lost lives in this area of Lake Huron. The first beacon on the island (1857) was provided by a temporary fixed light which was replaced by the tower. The actual lighthouse was first lit on 1 April 1859. Valuable in its day, it still emits a bright beam, but now, buoys and modern navigational tools are more important for safe navigation.The tower and the keeper's dwelling have been extensively restored. The dwelling is listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places while the Lightstation Tower is listed on the National Historic Sites of Canada. However, because the island is a bird sanctuary, only one company has a license to offer tours of the property and only on a limited basis. All other access to the island is prohibited.

Acrocercops panacivermiforma is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. It is known from New Zealand.The wingspan is about 10 mm. There is a separate South Island form.The larvae feed on "Nothopanax simplex" and "Nothopanax sinclairii". They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a simple gallery throughout, and is vermiform in character, the loops being very closely applied to one another, but never crossing. As a rule the gallery at first winds backwards and forwards in slightly increasing distances, closely applied to itself, and in a direction more or less parallel to the long axis of the leaf. Then it changes its direction for one almost at right angles to the earlier one, now crossing the leaf in curved sweeps from edge to midrib, this latter forming a certain obstacle to trespass on the other half of the leaf. On reaching the upper region of the leaf the mine becomes less vermiform in character and becomes rather tortuous in its direction, crossing the midrib in its upper and thinner part, and continuing down the other half of the leaf in more or less close proximity to the midrib or outer margin. This latter portion of the mine is often deeper in the leaf than the earlier part. The entire mine is in the upper surface of the leaf, and no trace of it can be seen beneath. The colour of the mine is a paler green than other portions of the leaf. The terminal portion of the gallery may be slightly enlarged, and within it the cocoon is constructed, a small area of the upper cuticle of the leaf at the extreme end of the mine being first prepared to a transparent thinness for the exit of the pupa later. The frass is finely granular, pale in colour, not very abundant, and occupies a rather broad band in the central third of the gallery.The mine made by the South Island form differs somewhat. In the earlier part the mine is a simple vermiform gallery. Later, however, instead of ending in a somewhat tortuous and widened gallery, it expands into a relatively large blotch, which may occupy the entire leaf, or all or the greater part of one half of the leaf in larger leaves. The entire mine is on the upper surface of the leaf, and is pale green in colour. The midrib forms a barrier in its basal two-thirds. The blotch is irregular in shape, but all irregularities are rounded. The frass is finely granular, black and scanty. Old mines soon become white and conspicuous.

The Battle of Cathair Cuan refers to a perhaps extended conflict fought in or between 977 and 978, or simply to a single battle in one or the other year, in Munster in Ireland. Attacking were Brian Bóruma and the Dál gCais, while defending were Donnubán mac Cathail and the remainder of the Viking army of Limerick. The latter were probably the followers of the newly elected and final "King of the Foreigners of Munster" Aralt mac Ímair, son of the recently slain Ivar of Limerick, although it is possible Donnubán was in overall command. Brian and the Dál gCais were victorious, with the result that the Limerick lordship and its territories were decisively lost to the Gaels until the Norman invasion of Ireland. Much had already been lost to the Dál gCais by 977, probably including the great dún of Limerick itself, but the lordship included other territories, some a number of miles inland, and the Norse-Irish themselves appear to have briefly remained viable in these. Aralt was probably slain in the conflict but Donnubán seems to have survived. Later accounts state he also was killed.

Kurnia Sandy is a retired Indonesian footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He played at Sampdoria's primavera (youth) team with Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto and Bima Sakti but not like his other former teammates, Kurnia succeeded to break into the first team and become the fourth choice goalkeeper for one season during the Sven-Göran Eriksson's era. At one time when Sampdoria's first choice goalkeeper Fabrizio Ferron is red carded, Sampdoria attempted to promote Sandy into the first team as a back up for Matteo Sereni, but apparently his management have yet to process Sandy's permit related papers. Thus Sampdoria entry was denied by the FIGC.Sandy made a memorable performance during Asian Cup where he denied at least 6 clear chance during the game against Kuwait, before rough contact against Kuwaiti player injures him and the game eventually ended 2-2. Sandy's injury was serious enough and forced him to recover for the rest of the tournament. Sandy's replacement Hendro Kartiko fine performance, and apparent dip in performance in the local league after his injury, made him lose the spot for the first choice goalkeeper in the national team to Kartiko.

Cyrtosperma merkusii or giant swamp taro, is a crop grown throughout Oceania and into South and Southeast Asia. It is a riverine and "swamp crop" similar to taro, but "with bigger leaves and larger, coarser roots." There are no demonstrably wild populations today, but it is believed to be native to Indonesia. It is known as "puraka" in Cook Islands, "lak" in Yap (Federated States of Micronesia), "babai" in Kiribati, "pula’a" in Samoa, "via kan" in Fiji, "pulaka" in Tokelau and Tuvalu, "simiden" in Chuuk, "swam taro" in Papua New Guinea, "navia" in Vanuatu and "palawan" in the Philippines.The same species is also known by the names "Cyrtosperma lasioides", "Cyrtosperma chamissonis" and "Cyrtosperma edule".In the harsh atoll environments of the Central Pacific, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, swamp taro is an important source of carbohydrates in a diet dominated by fish and coconut. Its cultivation is difficult and time-consuming, and the plant has deep cultural as well as practical significance. The roots need to be cooked for hours to reduce toxicity in the corms, but are rich in nutrients, especially calcium. The cultivation of Pulaka in Tuvalu, and babai in Kiribati, is an important cultural and culinary tradition, now under threat from rising sea level and displacement from the growing use of imported food products.In Nepal, Giant Swamp Taro is called "mane" and grows in the tropical and sub tropical forests along stream banks. It is gathered in January–February and all plant parts (leaf, stem, rhizomes) are savored after being boiled and roasted. The stem requires prolonged boiling and the water is replaced once to remove irritating chemicals. If cooked carefully, the rhizomes taste like taro and the leaves like spinach. But without careful washing, the food causes an unpleasant tingling or scratchy sensation.

The 2014 Tasmanian state election was held on 15 March 2014 to elect all 25 members to the House of Assembly. The 16-year incumbent Labor government, led by the Premier of Tasmania Lara Giddings, sought to win a fifth consecutive term against the Liberal opposition, led by Opposition Leader Will Hodgman. Also contesting the election was the Greens led by Nick McKim. The Palmer United Party made a significant effort in the election.The House of Assembly uses the proportional Hare-Clark system to elect 25 members in five constituencies electing five members each. Elections to the Legislative Council are conducted separately from House of Assembly elections. The election was conducted by the Tasmanian Electoral Commission.Before the election, Hodgman had indicated that he would only govern in majority. ABC News election analyst Antony Green suggested Hodgman's promise could have come back to haunt him if Palmer United were to siphon off enough votes to deny the Liberals enough seats for a majority in their own right. However, this became moot after the Liberals picked up an additional seat in every electorate except Denison, assuring them a majority. By 10:00 pm on election night, with the Liberals assured of winning at least 14 seats, Giddings conceded defeat on behalf of Labor. Ultimately, the Liberals won 15 seats, a decisive majority. Although this was just two more seats than necessary for a majority, under Tasmanian electoral practice of the time, winning 15 seats was considered a comprehensive victory.Hodgman took office on 31 March 2014, becoming only the fifth non-Labor premier in 80 years and only the third to govern in majority.Later, Giddings resigned as Labor party leader, and was succeeded by outgoing Deputy Premier Bryan Green on 31 March 2014.

"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1970 triple album "All Things Must Pass". Harrison wrote the song as a tribute to Frank Crisp, a nineteenth-century lawyer and the original owner of Friar Park – the Victorian Gothic residence in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, that Harrison purchased in early 1970. Commentators have likened the song to a cinematic journey through the grand house and the grounds of the estate.The recording features backing from musicians such as Pete Drake, Billy Preston, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Alan White. It was co-produced by Phil Spector, whose heavy use of reverb adds to the ethereal quality of the song. AllMusic critic Scott Janovitz describes "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)" as offering "a glimpse of the true George Harrison – at once mystical, humorous, solitary, playful, and serious".Crisp's eccentric homilies, which the former Beatle discovered inscribed inside the house and around the property, inspired subsequent compositions of Harrison's, including "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" and "The Answer's at the End". Together with the Friar Park-shot album cover for "All Things Must Pass", "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" established an association between Harrison and his Henley estate that has continued since his death in November 2001. The composition gained further notability in 2009 when it provided the title for Harrison's posthumous compilation "Let It Roll". My Morning Jacket lead singer Jim James and Dhani Harrison are among the artists who have covered the song.

The Four-Coalition (), also translated as the Coalition of Four or Quad-Coalition, abbreviated to 4K, was a liberal centre-right political alliance in the Czech Republic between 1998 and 2002.The four member parties were:* Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU–ČSL), an established, large Christian democratic party* Freedom Union (US), a new, large conservative liberal party that split from the Civic Democrats* Democratic Union (DEU), an established, small liberal party* Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), an established, small liberal conservative partyThe 4K was formed after the creation of the Opposition Agreement by the Czech Social Democratic Party and Civic Democratic Party in the aftermath of the 1998 election to the Chamber of Deputies. The coalition aimed to provide 'real opposition' to the government. The parties first participated together in the 1998 Senate election, achieving considerable success and winning 13 of the 27 seats up for election.The coalition formalised and centralised, with the merger of the US and DEU to form Freedom Union – Democratic Union (US-DEU) reducing the number of parties to three. However, the overbearing size of the KDU–ČSL – significantly larger than the others – lent instability to the coalition, as KDU–ČSL members used the coalition to further their intra-party factions. The KDU–ČSL put pressure on the ODA to further consolidate, either reforming its long-standing debts or merging with the US-DEU. The ODA refused, and withdrew from the Four-Coalition as a result.In the 2002 election to the Chamber, the KDU–ČSL and US-DEU ran on a looser joint ticket called 'Coalition' ("Koalice"), and won 31 seats and 14% of the vote—down from the combined 39 seats and 19% of votes in the 1998 election.
Kinnikinnick Creek is a shallow waterway that is part of the Scioto River watershed, flowing through southern Pickaway and northern Ross Counties in Ohio. The area through which the creek flows, which includes the villages of Wisler, Kingston and Kinnikinnick, Ohio is known locally as the Kinnikinnick Prairie.The Kinnikinnick has two branches, the main (north) branch, and the south branch. The creek’s northern headwaters form near the Pickaway County village of Leistville, Ohio, and flow south to the confluence of the creek’s southern branch, which has its head waters in Ross County. There, the creek begins its west-southwest path until it merges with the Scioto River north of the city of Chillicothe, Ohio.The creek was named for the Native American tobacco product kinnikinnick. The creek was a resource for Native Americans in the days before European Settlement. When white settlers moved into the region around 1800, Kinnikinnick was a significant source of fresh water for consumption, and crop irrigation.The Kinnikinnick is considered a major waterway feeder for the Scioto River by The Ohio State University Extension Services. Portions are navigable by canoe.

Telegraph Island (also known as Jazīrat al Maqlab or جزيرة_تليغراف, and Jazīrat Şaghīr) is located in the Elphinstone Inlet or Khor Ash Sham, the inner inlet of Khasab Bay, less than 400 meters off the shore of the Musandam Peninsula, and less than 500 meters south of much larger but also much lesser known Sham Island, both of which are parts of the Sultanate of Oman. It is 160 meters long, and up to 90 meters wide, yielding an area of 1.1 hectares. The name as "Telegraph" comes from the telegraph-cable repeater station built on the island in 1864.The inlet at the island is a fjord surrounded by high mountains, with notable geology in the rock strata which dip downwards under the immense pressures caused by the Arabian tectonic plate meeting (and subducting beneath) the Eurasian plate. In the 19th century, it was the location of a British repeater station used to boost telegraphic messages along the "Persian Gulf submarine cable" (see below), which was part of the London to Karachi telegraphic cable. It was not an easy posting for the operators, with the severe summer heat and hostility of local tribes making life extremely uncomfortable. Because of this, the island is, according to some travel agents and journalists, where the expression "go round the bend" comes from, a reference to the heat making British officers desperate to return to civilisation, which meant a voyage around the bend in the Strait of Hormuz back to India.Today, Telegraph Island is a reminder of the British Empire. Abandoned in the mid-1870s, the island has remained deserted and only the ruins of the repeater station and the operators' quarters can be seen. Tourism has grown in the Persian Gulf region, so the island is regularly visited by dhows carrying tourists to view the ruins and to fish and snorkel in the waters around it.

The highway stretches 17 km from Edapally in the Ernakulam district to Aroor in Alappuzha district , via. Palarivattom, Vyttila, Kundannoor, Madavana, Kumbalam. The Government of Kerala began the preliminary works in 1973. After a slow progress, it was partially opened for traffic in the beginning years of the 1980s. The section between Edapally and Vyttila had four lanes from the beginning. The rest of the carriageway was also upgraded to different sections of 4 lane, 5lane and 6 lanes by 2010The idea was to bypass the truck traffic out of the city proper. However now the city has outgrown the bypass leading to a heavy suburban traffic. Today, this road has turned out to be the most important arterial road in Kochi. The spacious road is going to replace the MG Road as the state's major commercial avenue in a few years time. Space crunch has really started to take toll on the MG Road, and the NH Bypass provides answer to all the problems faced by the former. Bypass Road has enough width to make the entire stretch into 6lane with service roads and a median. This 17-km stretch of road running across the city has become the hub of business for the city. This road Edapally - Aroor bypass is expected to slowly overtake MG road as the commercial hotspot of Kochi City and also Kerala state.The S.A.Road & Kaniyampuzha Road connects the stretch with Vyttila Mobility Hub (Said to be the biggest & most important Transport Hub of Kochi and one of the largest bus terminal in India).

The Palliser Region is an area in the southeast corner of the province of Alberta, Canada that has been delineated and is serviced by the Palliser Economic Partnership. It borders the Canadian province of Saskatchewan to the east, and the US state of Montana to the south. It covers an area of The total population of the area stood at 112,314 in 2009. The city of Medicine Hat, with a population of 61,097, is the area’s largest urban centre.The Palliser Region is the traditional territory of the Blackfoot Confederacy, who hunted bison throughout the area. From 1857 to 1860, the area was explored as part of the Palliser Expedition, led by John Palliser. He described the area of southeast Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan – now known as the Palliser Triangle – as semi-arid, and warned that it was unsuitable for agricultural development. European settlement began with the arrival of the North-West Mounted Police in the mid 19th century. Fort Walsh was established by Police Inspector James Morrow Walsh, who became a good friend of Sitting Bull when he led the Sioux to the area after the Battle of Little Big Horn.Despite the area’s semi-arid climate, the British government encouraged farmers to settle in the region. They struggled with drought up until the end of the 1930s, and many settlers abandoned their farms due to crop failure, but dryland farming techniques introduced by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration eventually transformed the region into a successful agricultural centre.The region’s geography is characterized by grasslands – including the Cypress Hills – and classic badlands country. The region receives more than 2,512 hours of sunshine per year on average, making it the sunniest area in Canada.The Palliser Region is intersected by two major highways, #1 and #3 on the east–west axis, connecting it to the rest of Canada, and two secondary highways, #36 and #41, on the north–south axis, which connect it to the US border. It is served by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which connects it to the rest of North America via connections with its affiliates. This transportation infrastructure is key to the region’s economy, which is based on agriculture, oil and gas, manufacturing, defence and aerospace, and tourism.The three fastest growing economic sectors in the Palliser Region are Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction, Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, and Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Leasing. Employment in the region is currently increasing at more than double the Canadian average.

The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism is a 1982 book by philosopher Michael Novak, in which Novak aims to understand and analyze the theological assumptions of democratic capitalism, its spirit, it values, and its intentions. Novak defines democratic capitalism as a pluralistic social system that contrasts with the unitary state of the traditional society and the modern socialist state. He analyzes it as a differentiation of society into three power centers: a political sector, an economic sector, and a moral-cultural sector. Each sector needs the others. Democracy needs the market economy and both need a pluralistic liberal culture. Against the continuing growth of democratic capitalism, modern socialism has contracted from a robust utopian program into vague "idealism about equality" and overwrought criticism of capitalism, most notably in the "liberation theology" of Latin America. Novak ends with the "beginnings of a theological perspective on democratic capitalism" illuminated by the journey from Marxism to realism of Reinhold Niebuhr.Irving Kristol described Novak's book as "unquestionably a major work for our times." The Spanish translation of the book served as inspiration for the Chilean lawyer and politician Jaime Guzmán where he was not satisfied by Hayek's thought.

Bazaari (Persian: بازاری ) is the name given to the merchant class and workers of bazaars, the traditional marketplaces of Iran. Bazaari are involved in "petty trade of a traditional, or nearly traditional, kind, centered on the bazaar and its Islamic culture". They have been described as "the class of people who helped make the 1979 Iranian Revolution".A broader, more recent definition includes traditional merchants outside of Iran, "a social class...in places where the society is in the midst of an awkward modernization; where the bazaar is in some stage of transition between the world of "A Thousand and One Nights" and that of the suburban shopping mall", an example being traditional merchants (also Muslim) who back the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. However, it has also been noted that merchants in other Middle Eastern countries are predominantly minority non-Muslim populations without the political influence of bazaari in Iran.Bazaari differ from a social class as usually defined, in that they include both "rich wholesalers and bankers" as well as lower-income workers. They are united not in their relation to the means of production but "in their resistance to dependence on the West and the spread of Western ways", their "traditionalist attitude", and their "close family, financial, and cultural ties" with the Shia ulama, or clerical class.Bazaari, "led by its large merchants", in alliance with ulama clergy "or important parts of the clergy", have played an important part in recent Iranian history. The alliance was "central" to the successful Tobacco Protest against a British monopoly tobacco concession of 1891–92, to the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–11, and especially to the 1979 overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Bazaari supported victims of the anti-Shah struggles in 1978 and their families, as well as providing "financial support for the antiregime strikes that began in May 1978 among university students and teachers and in the fall [of 1978] spread to the workers and civil servants".The bazaari continue to underpin the ruling elite today, one example being Noor Foundation Director Mohsen Rafighdoost, whose wealth has been described by American journalist Robert D. Kaplan as likely to amount to "tens or hundreds of millions of dollars".

Christopher Haigh is a British historian specialising in religion and politics around the English Reformation. Until his retirement in 2009, he was Student and Tutor in Modern History at Christ Church, Oxford and University Lecturer at Oxford University. He was educated at Churchill College, Cambridge and the University of Manchester. Haigh was a very influential revisionist in Tudor historiography and on the English Reformation.

Haigh has also been noted for his work in diminishing the significance attributed to anticlericalism prior to 1530. His revisionism formed part of a broader wave in Tudor historiography with other historians such as Eamon Duffy.

Though I Am Gone (Wo sui siqu ()) is a Chinese documentary film by Hu Jie about Bian Zhongyun, the vice principal of the Girls Middle School Attached to Beijing Normal University, who was beaten to death by her students in August 1966 during China's Cultural Revolution.The film includes the commentary and photographs taken by the deceased woman's husband, "Wang Qingyao, an 85 year-old, and a scholar of the Modern History Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences". The film is banned in China, where the Communist Party reacted sensitively to the film because "many of the former members of the Red Guard who attended Bian's middle school were members of the families of high-ranking officials that are still revered today."The director provides the hidden perspectives of the experiences and memories that are buried deeply within normal Chinese citizens during the Maoist periods and the Cultural Revolution through the use of personal and subjective records. The film also illustrates the scale of the terror that was unleashed by listing the 201 names on the screen at the end of film, in a four-minute incomplete roll call of the teachers that were killed in Beijing, China during the August 1966 Cultural Revolution. The list of names act as a reminder to the audience about the wrongful murderous killings by the Red Guards that was encouraged and permitted by Mao during the movement and also to pay respect to those who have tragically died in the violent revolution.

Pharmaceutical medicine is a medical discipline concerned with the discovery, evaluation, registration, monitoring and clinical aspects of pharmaceutical development. All medical specialties overlap to some extent, and likewise the boundaries of pharmaceutical medicine are elastic. But, at its centre is the clinical testing of medicines, translation of pharmaceutical drug research into new medicines, safety and well-being of patients and research participants in clinical trials, and understanding the safety profile of medicines and their benefit-risk balance. Pharmaceutical physicians work in the pharmaceutical industry, universities / medical schools, drug regulatory authorities and contract research organisations, but have a close affinity with their medical colleagues elsewhere.As a postgraduate medical discipline, pharmaceutical medicine has a recognised international syllabus, training courses with examinations and qualifications, its own research methodologies, professional bodies and academic societies, journals and texts, and embraces new technologies and regulations in pursuit of proof of efficacy, safety and effectiveness of medicines.Pharmaceutical medicine is a listed medical specialty in the UK, Ireland, Switzerland and Mexico. This official recognition is underlined by the availability of accredited education and training of specialist pharmaceutical physicians and the establishment and maintenance of standards of practice and professionalism in the competency, care and conduct applied to their work and of growing public recognition and accountability. In the UK, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians provides accreditation for the specialty.The basics of pharmaceutical medicine are founded in clinical pharmacology. In addition to expertise in basic research, drug development, and the structure and function of clinical trials, pharmaceutical physicians must possess a thorough understanding of pharmacoeconomics, medical aspects of the marketing pharmaceuticals, and business administration, and public healthEntry-level jobs with this qualification are often clinical research-related. At the entry level, PMST specialists often place into clinical research associate, clinical research analyst, pharmacodynamic data observer, clinical research project manager, drugs and pharmaceutical control manager in clinical research project, etc.

Regio Patalis is Latin for “the region of Patala”, that is the region around the ancient city of Patala at the mouth of the Indus River in Sindh, Pakistan. The historians of Alexander the Great state that the Indus parted into two branches at the city of Patala before reaching the sea, and the island thus formed was called Patalene, the district of Patala. Alexander constructed a harbour at Patala.While the Patala was well known to mariners and traders of the Ancient Mediterranean, by the European Middle Ages, mapmakers no longer knew its location. "Regio Patalis" appeared on late 15th and early 16th century maps and globes in a variety of increasingly erroneous locations, further and further east and south of India. It even appeared on some maps as a promontory of "Terra Australis".Some scholars identify Patala with Thatta, a one-time capital of Sindh. But the identity of Patala is much debated among scholars.

He was selected a Southern California "Super Lawyer" by Los Angeles Magazine in 2006-2010 and has been named in The Best Lawyers in America for over 10 years. The Los Angeles and San Francisco Daily Journals named him one of California's "Top 10 Copyright Lawyers" in 2008. In September 2010, he was named one of "The 25 Most Influential People in IP" in The American Lawyer's Fall 2010 Intellectual Property supplement (in the good company of such fellow honorees as Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy, PTO Director David Kappos, and Sen. Patrick Leahy.)Nimmer also served as the Chairman on the Committee on Intellectual Properties Litigation for the American Bar Association from 1989-1992.Since 1985, Nimmer has updated and revised "Nimmer on Copyright", the standard reference treatise in the field, first published in 1963 by his late father, Professor Melville B. Nimmer. Routinely cited by domestic and foreign courts at all levels in copyright litigation, cases within the United States have relied on Nimmer on Copyright as persuasive authority in over 2500 judicial opinions. He has also contributed to numerous other books, including "Le lisibile et l’illsibe" (2003), "Cases and Materials on Copyright and Other Aspects of Entertainment Litigation" (2002), "Artefacts and Intellectual Property" (2001), "Copinger and Skone James on Copyright" (1991), "OnMultimedia: Technologies for the 21st Century" (1990), "Droit des affaires" (1989), and "International Copyright Law and Practice" (1989–1998).

At present, along with UCLA colleague Prof. Neil Netanel, he is co-authoring a book for Oxford University Press regarding five centuries of rabbinic copyright responsa, entitled From "Maimonides to Microsoft".He has taught copyright at UCLA Law School for many years, as well as representing clients in the entertainment, publishing, and high-technology fields. He has twice gone to Washington D.C. on behalf of clients whose copyright matters were before the Supreme Court. The first occasion resulted in a unanimous decision in favor of his client, which simultaneously drew the boundaries between copyright and trademark protection. The second matter did likewise, in a decision issued in March 2010 that vitally affects all freelance writers in the country and the databases that present their historical works.Other litigation highlights include successfully representing Matthew Bender & Co. before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in its quest to unlock West's effective monopoly on presenting judicial opinions; convincing the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to rebuff an opponent's attempt to have copyright law control manufacture of a universal garage door opener; and winning a case in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appealsthat allowed his client unfettered rights to publish "Jesus: A New Revelation".

On this trip, Robson and McMinn signed six players: Jack Farrell, Samuel Meston and Willie Naughton from Stoke, Watty Keay from Derby County, Joe Turner from Dresden United and Alf Wood from Burslem Port Vale, as well as recruiting Stoke's long-serving trainer, Bill Dawson. The Saints committee were anxious to secure their services and signed them before the Football League season was over. Port Vale and Stoke lodged a complaint with the Football Association about "poaching"", and an emergency FA meeting was held at Sheffield, resulting in the Saints being severely censured for negligence. St Mary's were ordered to pay their own costs, plus £4 6s 3d to Stoke and £1 13s to Port Vale. McMinn was suspended for a year and Dawson for a month. Wood's registration with St Mary's was cancelled (shortly afterwards he moved to Stoke).During the summer of 1896, Robson resigned his position as secretary in order to concentrate on his cricket career, being replaced by McMinn (having served his twelve months' suspension), with Mr. E. Arnfield as his assistant. McMinn led the side to their best season since their foundation, winning the Southern League title at the third attempt and into the Second Round of the FA Cup.After one season in charge of the Saints, McMinn stepped down from day-to-day involvement with the team, with Arnfield replacing him.

The Council of Austerfield was an ecclesiastical synod held at Austerfield, in southern Northumbria in 702 or 703.The council was called by King Aldfrith of Northumbria to discuss whether Wilfrid should be returned to the see of York from which he had been expelled in 686. Wilfrid had appealed to the papacy around 700, and Pope Sergius I had sent the matter back to Britain to be decided locally. This resulted in Aldfrith convening the council in either 702 or 703 according to different sources. The date of the council has been calculated from two pieces of information: that it took place 22 years after the decision to expel Wilfrid from York, around 679–680, and that Wilfrid had held episcopal office for almost 40 years when Austerfield was convened. This would make the date of the council sometime before 704.The council was called at a place described as "in campo qui Eostrefeld dicitur" and "in campo qui dicitur Oustraefelda", which has led to the site of the council being identified with Austerfield near Bawtry in South Yorkshire (formerly in the West Riding of Yorkshire). Another possible location is Nosterfield near Ripon in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The main determining factor in favouring Austerfield over Nosterfield is that Nosterfield is not attested as a location before the 13th century.The council was presided over by Berhtwald, the Archbishop of Canterbury. It was attended by bishops from the entirety of the Anglo-Saxon church, both from Northumbria and from the southern part of Britain. Besides the bishops, abbots from monasteries in Britain are recorded as attending at Austerfield, and Wilfrid's biographer records that Wilfrid was accompanied by a number of priests and deacons. Laymen were also present, including King Aldfrith, as well as some of Aldfrith's thegns.One account of the council survives, that of Wilfrid's biographer, Stephen of Ripon in the "Vita Sancti Wilfrithi". Aldfrith and Berhtwald opposed Wilfrid's desire to return to York, but Wilfrid was supported by King Æthelred of Mercia, who had given Wilfrid shelter while he was in exile. Most of the bishops attending as well as some abbots appear to have opposed Wilfrid. According to Stephen, Wilfrid's opponents wanted to seize all Wilfrid's properties and offices, but Berhtwald offered a compromise that would have allowed Wilfrid to retain some monasteries but would have prevented him from performing the office of bishop. In response, Wilfrid gave a long speech that described all his career as a churchman. The main difficulty lay in Wilfrid's refusal to obey Berhtwald, who had archiepiscopal authority over him. The decision of the council was that Wilfrid should remain exiled from York and return to the monastery of Ripon and not leave and no longer be a bishop. Wilfrid disagreed with this decision and appealed to the papacy again.Wilfrid was eventually reconciled to the archbishop, bishops and laymen at the Council of Nidd in 705.

Aper-'Anati (also written Aper-Anat and Aperanat) was a ruler of Lower Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period in the mid-17th century BC. According to Jürgen von Beckerath he was the second king of the 16th Dynasty and a vassal of the Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty. This opinion was recently rejected by Kim Ryholt. In his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period, Ryholt argues that the kings of the 16th Dynasty ruled an independent Theban realm c. 1650–1580 BC. Consequently, Ryholt sees 'Aper-'Anati as an early Hyksos king of the 15th Dynasty, perhaps its second ruler. This analysis has convinced some Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and Janine Bourriau, but not others including Stephen Quirke.'Aper-'Anati is only known from a single scarab-seal, now in the Petrie Museum. On the scarab he is given the title of "Heka-chasut", which translates as "Ruler of the Foreign Lands" and from which the word "Hyksos" is derived. Significantly, this title was borne by the early Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty. Based on this evidence, Ryholt tentatively proposes that 'Aper-'Anati was the second ruler of the 15th Dynasty, but points out that this identification is not certain.

Triantha is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Tofieldiaceae, first described as a genus in 1879. False asphodel is a common name for plants in this genus."Triantha" has four known species. One of these is endemic to Japan. The other three are native to North America.A comparison of DNA sequences has indicated that "Triantha glutinosa" might be two species.Before the family Tofieldiaceae was established in 1995, "Triantha" and related genera were usually placed in Nartheciaceae, Liliaceae, or Melanthiaceae, but molecular phylogenetic studies of monocots and Alismatales have shown that inclusion of "Triantha" etc. in these families makes them polyphyletic.Some authors have included "Triantha" within the genus "Tofieldia". "Triantha" is distinguished from "Tofieldia" by its glandular-pubescent stems and by the presence of seed appendages. In 2011, a study of two nuclear genes and ten chloroplast genes showed that "Triantha" and "Tofieldia" are monophyletic and closely related sister clades. The species of "Triantha" are so closely related that the authors could not resolve any relationships among them.;Species# "Triantha glutinosa" - sticky asphodel - Canada, Alaska, Great Lakes region, Maine, scattered other spots in USA# "Triantha japonica" - Honshu# "Triantha occidentalis" -western false asphodel - Western Canada (Alb, BC), western United States (AK WA OR CA ID MT WY)# "Triantha racemosa" -coastal false asphodel - Coastal Plain of United States from TX to NJ

Inn signs have a history that extends beyond the Middle Ages, when many houses were identified by a sign, often a heraldic charge, which signified that the premises were under the special care of a nobleman, or a vivid image that impressed itself on the memory. The ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii reveal that most of their street-front shops displayed an identifying sign outside. In Ireland and the United Kingdom especially, the tradition, by which publicans were obliged to identify their premises by a sign, dating from the reign of Richard II, is carried on today. A selection of inn signs carved on slabs and rescued after the Great Fire of London is preserved in the Guildhall.

The Battle of Tres Forcas was a battle on 7 August 1856 between boat crews from the Prussian Navy corvette SMS "Danzig" (then on a foreign cruise, commanded by Prince Adalbert of Prussia) and the Berber Riffians. It occurred at Cape Tres Forcas in Morocco, and was one of the first examples of Prussian or German gunboat diplomacy.The Treaty of Paris of 1856 had decided that a Prussian warship should be deployed to the River Danube's outlet into the Black Sea and, on its way there, Prince Adalbert decided to explore the Rif coast of Morocco. There, four years earlier, on 7 December 1852, the Prussian warship "Flora" had been shot at by pirates, with one sailor killed and its captain injured.On 7 August 1856 Prince Adalbert manned two boats and deployed them along the coast. After the boats came under fire from the Riffians, the "Danzig" moved to only 600 metres from the shore to give the boat crews supporting fire. Adalbert then ordered a landing operation by 14 officers and 53 non commissioned officers, sailors and marines, led by Adalbert in person. Around noon, he led a surprise attack on a steep rock face nearly 40 metres high under heavy enemy fire. This attack was successful and the Riffians were forced back to a plateau. However, they were also receiving continuous reinforcements and so Adalbert finally decided to withdraw, in case he and his troops were cut off from the shore.Prussian casualties were seven dead and 22 wounded, including Adalbert, shot in the thigh. A subscription from the whole Prussian Navy raised a monument to the dead of the battle in Gibraltar in the form of an eagle, set up in 1863. Despite being a complete tactical failure, the landing and Adalbert and his sailors' courage were praised for decades to come by the Prussian people and particularly within the Prussian and German Imperial navies.

In the branch of abstract algebra called ring theory, the Akizuki–Hopkins–Levitzki theorem connects the descending chain condition and ascending chain condition in modules over semiprimary rings. A ring "R" (with 1) is called semiprimary if "R"/"J"("R") is semisimple and "J"("R") is a nilpotent ideal, where "J"("R") denotes the Jacobson radical. The theorem states that if "R" is a semiprimary ring and "M" is an "R" module, the three module conditions Noetherian, Artinian and "has a composition series" are equivalent. Without the semiprimary condition, the only true implication is that if "M" has a composition series, then "M" is both Noetherian and Artinian.The theorem takes its current form from a paper by Charles Hopkins and a paper by Jacob Levitzki, both in 1939. For this reason it is often cited as the Hopkins–Levitzki theorem. However Yasuo Akizuki is sometimes included since he proved the result for commutative rings a few years earlier, in 1935.Since it is known that right Artinian rings are semiprimary, a direct corollary of the theorem is: a right Artinian ring is also right Noetherian. The analogous statement for left Artinian rings holds as well. This is not true in general for Artinian modules, because there are examples of Artinian modules which are not Noetherian. Another direct corollary is that if "R" is right Artinian, then "R" is left Artinian if and only if it is left Noetherian.
John Nunatak () is an isolated granite nunatak in Antarctica, lying north of the Pirrit Hills.

Fade Street is a reality television show produced by RTÉ Two in Ireland. The format is loosely based on the style of American reality-TV shows such as "The Hills" and "The City". It follows the personal lives of a group of Dubliners, aged 20 to 29. The show's participants work in a variety of jobs, several of which are associated with the Dublin-based "Stellar" magazine.According to RTÉ, the show is unscripted and responses are spontaneous. As in "The Hills", many scenes in the show are manipulated by the show's creators. The characters are not given lines or a script, but instead react genuinely to the situations into which they are placed. Bystanders present during filming have called the reliability of this assertion into question, claiming the show's participants regularly do several retakes of scenes if the creators are not happy. In an RTÉ interview the cast denied allegations that the show is scripted, claiming that learning lines would be too difficult; Cici (one of the show's main characters) said, "it's completely unscripted".The soundtrack, featuring songs used in the show coming from up-and-coming (or established) Irish music artists, is central to the series.In August 2011 the show was renewed for a second season on RTÉ 2 Television, with the webisodes-portion exclusion on RTÉ Player.

He began his life of crime at an early age, stealing a bicycle from a boy in North Wilkesboro N.C. He was quickly caught and spent time in the Wilkes County Jail. He was subsequently sentenced to serve on a chain gang, but the foreman sent him home to his mother due to his age.Wood hopped his first train when he was seven, travelling to stay with relatives in West Virginia. There, his kinfolk (the McCoy-feuding Hatfields) taught him how to gamble, make illegal whisky and fight.He suffered from a foot ailment (a birth defect) and lost his left hand when he was a teenager. According to some reports he lost his hand in an accident while working for the railroad in West Virginia. Another story, told by relatives, is that the injury occurred while Wood was hunting.Repeated scrapes with the law, mostly involving thefts and bootlegging, led to numerous incarcerations in jails in North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. He is credited with a total of 10 jail breaks throughout his criminal career.In 1923, Wood was charged with the murder of A.W. Kaplan, a Greensboro, N.C. pawnbroker. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve 30 years in N.C. Central Prison in Raleigh. After that conviction, Wood made four escapes from the state prison. During his time in that prison, Wood wrote an autobiography.Following his last escape, Wood was spotted by police officers in Salisbury, N.C., on December 31, 1930. They approached Wood, killing him in the ensuing shootout.A year after his death, the Carolina Buddies recorded the song "Otto Wood The Bandit" on Columbia Records.Other musicians, including Doc Watson and Norman Blake, have recorded versions of the song. A stage play on the bandit’s life is produced each June at The Record Park in North Wilkesboro, N.C.

Saint Triduana, also known as Trodline, Tredwell, and in Norse as Trøllhaena, was an early Christian woman, associated with various places in Scotland. She lived at an unknown time, probably between the 4th and 8th centuries CE.According to the 16th-century "Aberdeen Breviary", Triduana was born in the Greek city of Colosse, and travelled from Constantinople with Saint Rule, who brought the bones of Saint Andrew to Scotland in the 4th century AD. A pious woman, she settled at Rescobie near Forfar in Angus, but her beauty attracted the attentions of a King of the Picts named Nectan. To stall these unwanted attentions, Triduana tore out her own eyes and gave them to Nechtan. Afterwards, she was associated with curing eye disorders. She spent her later years in Restalrig, Lothian, and healed the blind who came to her. She was buried at Restalrig when she died.The 17th-century "Acta Sanctorum" records a story of a blind English woman miraculously cured by Triduana. The saint appears to her in a dream, and instructs her to travel to Restalrig. She does so, and regains her sight at Triduana's tomb. The woman's daughter is later cured of blindness after praying to Triduana.In the 12th century, the Norse Earl of Orkney Harald Maddadsson punished bishop John of Caithness by having him blinded. According to the 13th-century Orkneyinga Saga, John prayed to "Trøllhaena", and later regained his sight when brought to her "resting place", possibly referring to a local northern shrine rather than Restalrig.The principal centre of devotion to Triduana was at Restalrig, now part of Edinburgh. The parish church has been rebuilt, but the associated 15th-century St Triduana's Aisle (originally two-storeyed) survives. This partly subterranean structure often flooded in the past, and was at one time assumed to be an unusually large and elaborate holy well (St Triduana's Well). The exterior of the aisle was heavily restored by the architect Thomas Ross in 1907, though its interior (which has a remarkable echo) retains its original rib-vault, and is a refined example of Scottish 15th-century architecture. Other dedications to Triduana include chapels at Ballachly (Caithness), Loth (Sutherland), and on Papa Westray in Orkney.The Sicilian Saint Lucy is also said to have torn out her own eyes to put off an unwelcome suitor.In Buddhist scripture (Therigatha 14.1) the Buddhist nun Subha also removed her eye in response to admiration from a suitor. In that case, the act served as a lesson in non-attachment to worldly things.

Abstract Speed + Sound (Italian: Velocità astratta + rumore) is a painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla, one of several studies of motion created by the artist in 1913–14. The painting may be the second in a triptych narrating the passage of a racing car through a landscape, beginning with "Abstract Speed" ("Velocità + paesaggio") (1913) and ending with "Abstract Speed—The Car Has Passed" (1913). The three paintings share indications of a single landscape, and each painting is continued onto its frame.Balla chose the automobile as a symbol of speed, reflecting the statement of Futurist founder Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's 1909 first manifesto: "The world's splendor has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed... A roaring automobile...that seems to run on shrapnel, is more beautiful than the "Victory of Samothrace"." The painting evokes the sensation of the passing of an automobile, with crisscrossing lines representing sound.The painting is said to have captured the ideals of Italian Futurism. It was featured on the 1980 British television series "100 Great Paintings", which presented five paintings from each of 20 thematic groups.The Philadelphia Museum of Art houses an apparent study for the painting, a work in watercolor and graphite.

View of the Cannaregio Canal was painted by Francesco Guardi around 1770. It is a small oil on canvas painting measuring 48.9 × 77.5 cm. It now hangs in the reading room of the Frick Art Reference Library alongside the "Regatta in Venice". Both paintings were gifted to the Frick Collection by Helen Clay Frick after her father's death. In the painting, Guardi captures a typical scene of Venetian life on the canals. In this particular veduta, Guardi depicts a section of the northern bank of the Cannaregio Canal, one of Venice’s largest canals, located in the Cannaregio "sestiere" (district) of the city.The Palazzo Surian Bellotto is the most prominent building in the painting, named after the two different families who owned the palace: first the Surian family and then the Bellotto family.The Ponte dei Tre Archi connects the northern bank with the small fragment of the southern bank. The bridge’s arch acts as a viewfinder, focusing the viewer’s gaze onto the tiny patch of pure blue, breaking up the otherwise entirely urban landscape.Another building that features in this view is the Santa Maria delle Penitenti. It is recognizable by its circular window below the roof and placement behind the Ponte dei Tre Archi. This church was designed by Giorgio Massari in 1725 and the façade was never completed.

Archaeological excavation of the site in 1983 and 1984 by paleontologists Larry Agenboard and Jim Mead unearthed animal bones, dung, hair, and teeth dating from 11,555 BCE to 9720 BCE, underneath "a few feet" of cave fill, consisting of ceiling spall and wind-blown sand, containing evidence of Holocene habitation from the Archaic period to the Basketmaker culture and possibly even by Navajo or Paiute. Among the items unearthed were large dung boluses, similar in size to the dung of the African elephant, containing the stems of graminoids and sedge ("Carex"). The cave is also one of at least seventeen sites on the Colorado Plateau where Archaic-era Southwestern sandals have been discovered.The cave's name derives from a Navajo word meaning "big dung" or "big feces". The well-preserved dung layer was deposited over approximately 1,000 years by multiple animal species during a period characterized by the proliferation of oak and the decline of blue spruce and water birch. The organic deposit consists primarily of Columbian mammoth ("M. columbi") dung but also includes dung belonging to shrub-oxen ("E. collinum"), Shasta ground sloths ("N. shastensis"), Harrington's mountain goats ("O. harringtoni"), bighorn sheep ("O. canadensis"), cottontail rabbits, pack rats, and possibly equines. With a thickness ranging between , an area of more than , and a volume of , it is the largest coprolite deposit in North America. Other macrofossils discovered in Bechan Cave include teeth and a bone, a "metapodial condyle", belonging to "E. collinum".The cave is located inside Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and, though it is rarely visited, is accessible on foot from Bowns Canyon. The round-trip hike between Bowns Canyon, which can be reached from Lake Powell by boat, and Bechan Cave is considered moderately difficult.

Wheelchair sport classification is a system designed to allow fair competition between people of different disabilities, and minimize the impact of a person's specific disability on the outcome of a competition. Wheelchair sports is associated with spinal cord injuries, and includes a number of different types of disabilities including paraplegia, quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome and spina bifida. The disability must meet minimal body function impairment requirements. Wheelchair sport and sport for people with spinal cord injuries is often based on the location of lesions on the spinal cord and their association with physical disability and functionality.Classification for spinal cord injuries and wheelchair sport is overseen by International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS). Classification for spinal cord injuries internationally is also handled on a sport specific basis, with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) being the classifier for a number of sports including alpine skiing, biathlon, cross country skiing, ice sledge hockey, powerlifting, shooting, swimming, and wheelchair dance. Classification is also handled nationally by national wheelchair sport organizations, or sport specific organizations.Wheelchair sport classification was first experimented with by Ludwig Guttmann at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital during the 1940s, and was formalized in the 1950s. This was a medical based classification system. It was the used International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF) at their founding in 1960, when the first International Stoke Mandeville Games were held in Rome. The 1960s, 1970s and 1980s would see a debate about the merits of the medical based system. Changes towards a functional classification system started in some sports in the late 1970s and 1980s before going wider in the early 1990s. Major changes took place in the 1990s, which facilitated the ability for people with spinal cord injuries to compete with people with different types of disabilities. These trends continued into the 2000s.Traditionally, the classes used for IWAS have been based on track and field with these being applied for other sports. There are four classes for track and eight for track and field. These classes are known as F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7 and F8. They are comparable to sport specific classes used by other classifying bodies. The process for classification has a medical and functional classification process. This process is often sport specific.
The Earlham Public School is a historic building located in Earlham, Iowa, United States. The town's name was chosen by the Quakers, who were the largest group of settlers in the community.

This building was used by the elementary grades. School districts were consolidated in 1920 and a larger building that could accommodate all grades was built in Earlham. This building was used from that point as a Masonic lodge until it was converted into a local museum. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Harriet Merrill Johnson (born 1886 in Bangor, Maine), graduated from the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital and began working as a district nurse at the Henry Street Settlement. While working as a district nurse, Johnson became interested in the needs of children. She, Lucy Sprague Mitchell, and Caroline Pratt formed the Bureau of Education Experiments in 1916, now known as Bank Street College of Education. Their aim was to bring various specialists and researchers together for the purposes of studying experimental education. Johnson was the founder and first director of the bureau's nursery school, which was later named in her honor. This nursery school was the direct predecessor to Bank Street's School for Children, a private elementary school operating under the college's umbrella. Johnson was the author of several texts on education:*The Visiting Teacher (1916)*A Nursery School Experiment: Descriptive Report (1924)*Children in Nursery School (1928) *The Art of Block Building (1933) *School Begins at Two: A Book for Teachers and Parents (1936)Harriet Johnson Nursery SchoolThe Harriet Johnson Nursery School opened in 1918 at the Bureau's new quarters in a series of houses on West 12th and West 13th Street. The staff included teachers, psychologists and researchers who worked to discover the environments in which children grew and learned to their full potential. The staff observed how children learned, and they began documenting the learning process in order to determine the environments and educational practices best suited to foster the growth and development of children. Their findings contributed to a fundamental reform in the way children were taught. Graduates from Johnson's Nursery school went to Caroline Pratt's City and Country School. The nursery school also educated teachers and others on how to create these environments. Children at Johnson's Nursery school were given opportunities to draw, paint and model in clay. These were unusual forms of expression in schools at this time. A child's education was recognized as something other than prescribed curriculum. The children here and at Caroline Pratt's City and Country School, under the support of the Bureau, had all of New York City as their classroom. They were able to ride ferries, visit zoos and look at bridges.
The Heppner flood of 1903 was a major flash flood along Willow Creek responsible for destroying a large portion of Heppner, Oregon, United States, on June 14, 1903. With a death toll of 247 people, it remains the deadliest natural disaster in Oregon,and the second deadliest flash flood in the entire United States, behind the 1889 Johnstown Flood and ahead of the 1972 Black Hills Flood.The flood caused over $600,000 in damage,equivalent to $ today.After an exceptionally dry spring, strong thunderstorms moved over the Heppner area on June 14, 1903. Torrential rain and hail began falling on the watersheds of Willow Creek and two of its largest tributaries, Balm Fork and Hinton Creek, by 16:30.The region's arid climate and little vegetation coupled with the ground already being wet from a storm three days earlier caused very little water to be absorbed by the soil, and soon the streams were flooding. Within fifteen minutes after the rain began to fall, water rushed down the streams (mainly the Balm Fork), towards Heppner.A steam laundry building on the southern edge of Heppner built across Willow Creek acted as a dam when the water arrived, failing under the stress several minutes later. This sent a wall of water cascading down Willow Creek that quickly reduced many of Heppner's structures to rubble.Some structures were ripped off their foundations and floated downstream. At its peak, over of water raced down Willow Creek,more than the average flow of the much larger Willamette River to the west. Many people were able to escape to higher ground, but 247—nearly a quarter of Heppner's population at the time—died. The waters finally receded around an hour later. Numerous houses in Heppner were destroyed, and around 140 total structures, about one-third of Heppner, were washed away. Heppner's population did not completely recover to pre-1903 levels for several decades.After the flood inundated Heppner, two of its residents, Les Matlock and Bruce Kelly, rode on horseback to warn the cities of Lexington and Ione, downstream, respectively. The flood washed through Lexington at about 19:00, just before they arrived, destroying several buildings. Matlock and Kelly continued north to Ione, overtaking the flood and warning the bewildered residents to evacuate. No one was killed in Ione or Lexington. However, the floodwaters washed raw sewage from Heppner downstream, contaminating wells in both Lexington and Ione. As a result, at least 18 people died from typhoid fever over the next several months.The flood led to flood control studies in 1962, 1965, and 1979. The Willow Creek Dam was completed in 1983 to prevent such a flood in the future. It is the first major roller-compacted concrete dam.Pendleton, Oregon photographer Walter S. Bowman captured images of the aftermath.

Tierney Peninsula () is an ice-covered peninsula about 14 nautical miles (26 km) long, between Savage Glacier and Morgan Inlet in the east end of Thurston Island. The east extremity of the peninsula (and Thurston Island overall) is Cape Annawan. These features were discovered on helicopter flights from the USS Burton Island and Glacier of the U.S. Navy Bellingshausen Sea Expedition in February 1960 and named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN). The peninsula was named for J.Q. Tierney, oceanographer aboard the Burton Island on this expedition. The cape was named for the ship "Annawan" of the United States Expedition of 1829–31, which with the Penguin sailed west from the South Shetland Islands in February 1830, holding a course between 62S and 58S and exploring as far as 103W, northward of this cape.Two nautical miles (3.7 km) west of the base is Pallid Crest, a solitary ice-covered ridge visible from a considerable distance and various directions. It was named by US-ACAN because of its whitish appearance.

Thilenius" 1926, Hamburg). His second voyage is described in "Hawaii, Ostmikronesien und Samoa. Meine zweite Südseereise" (1897–1899) "zum Studium der Atolle und ihrer Bewohner" published in Stuttgart by Strecker & Schröder, 1906.

However, linguistic analysis of his diaries indicates that he had extensive assistance of a Samoan chief, Tofā Sauni. The depth of this involvement by Tofā Sauni in Krämer's study should have led to him being a co-author of the volume by modern ethical standard in ethnography.

Crédit Mobilier (officially the Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier, or General Society of Home Credit) was a French banking company created by the Pereire brothers, and one of the most important financial institutions of the world during the mid-19th century. It had a major role in the financing of numerous railroads and other infrastructure projects by mobilizing the savings of middle class French investors as capital for vast lending schemes. The Crédit Mobilier investments created vast debts for the countries which accepted these infrastructure loans and was thus indirectly involved in the European occupations of the countries whose governments defaulted on these loans during the worldwide economic depression of the 1870s.It became a powerful and dynamic funding agency for major projects in France, Europe, North Africa and the world at large. As Napoleon III redeveloped Paris, the Crédit Mobilier speculated on real estate with inside information and collaborated with Hausmann to develop neighborhoods such as rue de Rivoli, Opéra, and place de l'Etoile. Beyond France, it specialized in mining development; it funded other banks including the Imperial Ottoman Bank and the Austrian Mortgage Bank; it funded railway construction and insurance companies, as well as building contractors. The bank had large investments in transatlantic steamship lines, urban gas lighting, a newspaper and the Paris public transit system.In 1866/7, the bank underwent a severe crisis, and the Pereire brothers wereforced to resign at the demand of their enemy, the Banque de France; the Crédit Mobilier never recovered.

The Scripting Layer for Android (abridged as SL4A, and previously named Android Scripting Environment or ASE) is a library that allows the creation and running of scripts written in various scripting languages directly on Android devices.SL4A is designed for developers and is still alpha quality software, with its main branch no longer being under active development. As of January 2016, other developers have forked the SL4A code to enable it to run on Android Lollipop and Android Marshmallow after development on the main code branch stopped, for example the "kuri65536" branch of SL4A and "droid-python".These scripts have access to many of the APIs available to normal Java Android applications, but with a simplified interface. Scripts can be run interactively in a terminal, or in the background using the Android services architecture. Currently supported languages are:* Python using CPython* Perl* Ruby using JRuby* Lua* BeanShell* JavaScript using Rhino* Tcl* Rexx using BRexxSL4A was first announced by Google in June 2009, and was originally named "Android Scripting Environment" (ASE). It is, however, not an official Google product, even though many of its developers have worked for Google. It was originally developed by Damon Kohler, and has grown through the contributions of many developers.
